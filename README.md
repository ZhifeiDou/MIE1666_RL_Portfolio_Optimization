# MIE1666_RL_Portfolio_Optimization
This is the project for MIE1666 2024 Fall Team 5: Leveraging Transformer in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization.
As Google Collab allows the running of 3 ipynb files in parallel, all code is simply in Jupyter Notebook to save hyperparameter tuning time. 

Folder and explanations:
ft_val -> final hyperparameter tuning for the transformer model in the deep reinforcement learning structure 
final_comparsion -> Train the transformer with the tuned hyperparameter setting and evaluate it with the test dataset, compare with baseline models

Environment required:
python 3.9/3.10
pytorch == 2.5.1
cuda == 11.8
tushare == 1.4.6
ray == 2.39.0
gymnasium == 1.0.0
