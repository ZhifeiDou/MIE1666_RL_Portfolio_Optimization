# MIE1666_RL_Portfolio_Optimization

This is the project for MIE1666 2024 Fall Team 5: Leveraging Transformer in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization

All code are simply in jupyter notebook so just simply setup the env and run. Or upload to google collab is also fine

Folder and explanations:

ft_val -> Fine-tuning for the transformer PPO 

final_comparsion -> Train the transformer PPO with the tuned hyperparameter setting and evaluate it withthe  test dataset, compare with baseline models

Environment required:
python 3.9/3.10
pytorch == 2.5.1
cuda == 11.8
tushare == 1.4.6
ray == 2.39.0
gymnasium == 1.0.0
